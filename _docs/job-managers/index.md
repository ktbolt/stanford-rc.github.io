# Job Management

How do you run jobs on a supercomputer? The answer is that you log in to
one of several interactive or "home" nodes, and then submit jobs to a queue
managed by a workload manager. As an example, [SLURM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager),
 the "Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management" is installed on several of
our clusters. In these sections, we will provide general
instructions for how to use different managers.
