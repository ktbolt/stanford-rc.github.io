# About

The Stanford Research Computing Center (SRCC) is a joint effort of the Dean of Research and IT Services to build and support a comprehensive program to advance computational research at Stanford. That includes offering and supporting traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems, as well as systems for high throughput and data-intensive computing. The SRCC also helps researchers transition their analyses and models from the desktop to more capable and plentiful resources, providing the opportunity to explore their data and answer research questions (on-premise or in the cloud) at a scale typically not possible on desktops or departmental servers. Partnering with units like [ICME](http://icme.stanford.edu) as well as the NSF [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) program and select vendors, the SRCC offers training and learning opportunities around high-end computing tools and technologies.

In addition, we offer for-fee bulk research storage (the Oak platform - currently at 5 PB), and systems engineering, administration and support for faculty research systems, servers, and clusters on an annual contract basis.

This site serves as a documentation portal to easily find the resource you are looking for.
